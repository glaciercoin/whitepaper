Glacier Coin - Unstoppable Climate Change

## The GlacierCoin DAO
Glacier Coin will be issued as an ERC-20 token and used to create the Glacier DAO. The DAO's mission will be to solve climate change. With the unstoppable power of the blockchain we democratise access to climate change.

## Unstoppable Project 
### Zuri Glacier - PRIORITY ZERO
The Zurich climate crisis reached an insufferable peak temperature in excess of 37 degrees Celsius in 2022. This is very bad because Switzerland was denied air conditioning due to greedy short sellers. Therefore, the Glacier DAO will leverage the power of the unstoppable blockchain. We will deploy into Lake Zurich a large glacier taken from the Nordic Arctic. The cooling effect will immediately cut temperatures. Further we plan to develop a crypto Swiss chalet Christmas market and Chalet on the top surface of the glacier where Glacier Coin and other crypto currencies will be used to purchase fondue, raclette and BÃ¼ndnerfleisch.
